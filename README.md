# luminata-scraper

As a prerequisite, make sure you have Visual Studio Code downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

First download this repository from the terminal command line:
`git clone https://github.com/VedaantS/luminata-scraper.git; cd luminata-scraper; open -a "Visual Studio Code" file.py;`

Then, when `file.py` opens up in Visual Studio Code, edit the sender_email and sender_password variables to match your email and password:
<br>`sender_email = "vedaant@luminataprep.com"`<br>
`sender_password = "password123"`

Then, run `python3 file.py` in Terminal. Everything should then send automatically.
